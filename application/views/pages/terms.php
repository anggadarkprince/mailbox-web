                <p>
                    We provide our Services using a commercially reasonable level of skill and care and we hope
                    that you will enjoy using them. But there are certain things that we don't promise about our Services.

                <p>
                    If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms.
                    It will hold harmless and indemnify <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees
                    from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation

                <h3 class="bold">About these Terms</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are using our Services on behalf of a business, that business accepts these terms.
                    It will hold harmless and indemnify <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> and its affiliates, officers, agents, and employees
                    from any claim, suit or action arising from or related to the use of the Services or violation
                    of these terms, including any liability or expense arising from claims, losses, damages, suits,
                    judgments, litigation costs and attorneys' fees.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may modify these terms or any additional terms that apply to a Service to, for example,
                    reflect changes to the law or changes to our Services. You should look at the terms regularly.
                    We'll post notice of modifications to these terms on this page. We'll post notice of modified
                    additional terms in the applicable Service. Changes will not apply retroactively and will become
                    effective no sooner than fourteen days after they are posted. However, changes addressing new
                    functions for a Service or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. If you
                    do not agree to the modified terms for a Service, you should discontinue your use of that Service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If there is a conflict between these terms and the additional terms, the additional terms will
                    control for that conflict.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These terms control the relationship between <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> and you. They do not create any third party
                    beneficiary rights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you do not comply with these terms, and we don't take action right away, this doesn't mean
                    that we are giving up any rights that we may have (such as taking action in the future).
