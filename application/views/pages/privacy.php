                <p>
                    There are many different ways you can use our services - to search for and share information, to communicate with other
                    people or to create new content. When you share information with us, for example by creating a <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> Account, we can make
                    those services even better - to show you more relevant search results and ads, to help you connect with people or to make
                    sharing with others quicker and easier. As you use our services, we want you to be clear how we're using information and
                    the ways in which you can protect your privacy.
                </p>

                <h3 class="bold">Information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                    We collect information to provide better services to all of our users - from figuring out basic stuff like which language you
                    speak, to more complex things like which ads you'll find most useful, the people who matter most to you online, or which
                    activity you might like.
                </p>

                <h3 class="bold">How we use information we collect</h3>
                <p>
                    We use the information we collect from all of our services to provide, maintain, protect and improve them, to develop new
                    ones, and to protect <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> and our users. We also use this information to offer you tailored content like giving you more
                    relevant search results and ads.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We may use the name you provide for your <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> Profile across all of the services we offer that require a <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> Account. In
                    addition, we may replace past names associated with your <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> Account so that you are represented consistently across all
                    our services. If other users already have your email, or other information that identifies you, we may show them your publicly
                    visible <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> Profile information, such as your name and photo.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will ask for your consent before using information for a purpose other than those that are set out in this Privacy Policy.
                    <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong> processes personal information on our servers in many countries around the world. We may process your personal
                    information on a server located outside the country where you live.
                </p>

                <h3 class="bold">Information you share</h3>
                <p>
                    Many of our services let you share information with others. Remember that when you share information publicly, it may be
                    indexable by search engines, including <strong>Kemendesa MailBox</strong>. Our services provide you with different options on sharing and removing your
                    content.
                </p>

                <h3 class="bold">Accessing and updating your personal information</h3>
                <p>
                    Whenever you use our services, we aim to provide you with access to your personal information. If that information is wrong,
                    we strive to give you ways to update it quickly or to delete it unless we have to keep that information for legitimate business or
                    legal purposes. When updating your personal information, we may ask you to verify your identity before we can act on your
                    request.
